# eCommerce-Coderhouse-final
This is the project I've been working on during my Coderhouse Javascript course

I got the idea from a partner, who is willing to sell products online. He doesn't know which type of things to sell yet, so I've decided to implement my favourite kind of stuff there, fancy decks of cards.
